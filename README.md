1) Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers to automatically learn useful patterns and representations from data.
2) Brief;
* Model: networks of connected units (neurons) arranged in layers; “deep” means many hidden layers.
* Learning: the network predicts outputs from inputs; a loss measures errors; weights are adjusted by backpropagation + an optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam).
* Representation: lower layers learn simple features (edges, phonemes, tokens) and deeper layers build higher-level concepts (objects, meanings).
* Data & compute: deep models perform best with large datasets and significant compute.
3) Common architectures;
* CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) — images, vision tasks.
* RNNs / LSTMs — sequence data (older approach for time series, text).
* Transformers — current state-of-the-art for language, many sequence tasks, and multimodal models.
